we will need to fix the css of imageCroppe.
    things should not go totally out of the screen.
        this can be fixed by doing some calculation according to the aspect ratio of the image.
        we need to setup the size of the imae cropper part the image preview part.
        if we will fix the size of th image cropper the size issue of the image privewer will automatically get fixed.
        (this kind of issue is already taken care in zoneMapper)

need to add a backend relay part of this so that people does not simply copy the code.

setting up the image on the vastu zonner will be the right place to wait for the backend call.
